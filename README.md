# Neurograph
A universal decentralized database of everything imaginable and then some.

## Basics

### Links
A link is a connection from a link to a link.  
A link is often paired with a weight that indicates its proportionately assigned importance within a neurograph.

### Nodes
A node is a given link paired with a proportionately weighted set of all links from the given link.  
In general, a basic node is based on a circular link, but complex nodes can be based on any link.  
A co-node is a link paired with the proportionately weighted set of all links to it.  
A dual-node is a link paired with the pair of both proportionately weighted sets of incoming and outgoing links.
